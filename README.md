#  Brain Tumor Segmentation using MRI Images

## Project Overview

This project implements a deep learning-based brain tumor segmentation system using MRI images. A custom **U-Net** architecture with a **MobileNetV2** encoder was developed to accurately identify tumor regions from brain MRI scans. The project includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, visualization of predicted masks, and deployment through an interactive Gradio web application.
